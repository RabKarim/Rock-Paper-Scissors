# Rock-Paper-Scissors

Creating a basic Rock-Paper-Scissors program using javascript in a html document. I have added UI elements and added a running total of each time the player and the computer win a round.

In the future I would like to add a condition where if the player or compuer reaches 5 wins then it would reset.
